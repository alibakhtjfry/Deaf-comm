# DeafComm

**Real-Time Speech ↔ Sign Language Communication System**

DeafComm is an AI-driven communication platform developed to support **instant, two-way interaction between deaf/mute individuals and hearing users**.
The system enables communication by translating **sign language into text** and converting **spoken or written language into sign language using a 3D animated avatar**.

The project addresses accessibility challenges by combining **computer vision, deep learning, natural language processing, and mobile application development** into a unified assistive solution.

## 🌱 Repository Structure

The repository is organized using a **modular design philosophy** to ensure clarity, scalability, and ease of maintenance.

* `main` – Consolidated and stable implementation
* Supporting directories – AI models, avatar system, backend services, and mobile UI components

This structure allows independent module development and seamless integration.

---

## 🔁 System Integration Overview

The system consists of interconnected modules that collectively enable real-time communication:

* Sign language recognition and text generation
* Speech/text processing and sign language synthesis
* Avatar-based sign visualization
* Backend APIs for communication between models and mobile interface

Each module operates independently while contributing to the complete communication pipeline.

---

## 🧠 Core System Features

* ✔ Real-time sign language to text translation
* ✔ Speech and text to sign language conversion
* ✔ Deep learning-based gesture recognition
* ✔ Progressive transformer-based motion prediction
* ✔ 3D avatar visualization for sign output
* ✔ MediaPipe-based hand landmark extraction
* ✔ Backend API layer for model integration
* ✔ Mobile-friendly user interface
* ✔ Performance evaluation using accuracy, SER, and latency metrics

The system supports **bidirectional communication**, enabling meaningful interaction for both user groups.
